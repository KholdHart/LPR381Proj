=== LPR381 PROJECT - CLEAN STRUCTURE ===

üéØ ESSENTIAL FILES ONLY - STREAMLINED FOR TESTING

=== ALGORITHM FILES (4 TOTAL) ===

üìÅ FOR PRIMAL SIMPLEX (Algorithm 1):
   ‚úÖ universal_lp.txt    - Simple 2-variable continuous LP
   ‚úÖ model.txt          - Standard 3-variable continuous LP

üìÅ FOR BRANCH & BOUND (Algorithm 3):
   ‚úÖ universal_ip.txt    - Simple 2-variable integer programming
   ‚úÖ universal_binary.txt - 3-variable binary programming (0-1)

=== QUICK TEST PROCEDURE ===

1. Run: .\bin\Debug\LPR381Proj.exe

2. Test Primal Simplex:
   - Load: universal_lp.txt
   - Algorithm: 1 (Primal Simplex)
   - Expected: Canonical form + tableau iterations

3. Test Branch & Bound:
   - Load: universal_ip.txt  
   - Algorithm: 3 (Branch & Bound)
   - Expected: Tree exploration + integer solution
